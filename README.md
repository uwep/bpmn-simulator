# bpmn-simulator
A graphical animation tool for BPMN 2.0 models

Refactored implementation of https://github.com/steschw/bpmn-simulator including message flow, event based gateways and many more

Uses java 9 or newer for better graphics; needs javax.activation as runtime/deploy dependency

Models should be edited by 
* [Yaoqiang BPMN Editor] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bpmn/)
since it provides amongst others labels for naming tasks, setting condition expressions.
